1. AcceLeNetor-master: https://github.com/cedard234/AcceLeNetor/tree/master
- The smaller LeNet5 model, test ok after 3 trying time using ModelSim. I didn't try with Quartus.
2. ECE385final_digit_recognition: https://github.com/DouglasYu/ECE385final_digit_recognition/tree/main
- I tried on Quartus, it compiled successfully but I couldn't test because it demands camera OV7670 as the input devices.
3. LeNet5 verilog: https://github.com/djtfoo/lenet5-verilog/blob/master/src/lenet5.v
- This is the common model using pipeline architecture, I built the similar model on Python and exported parameters but it didn't work/gave the correct results.
